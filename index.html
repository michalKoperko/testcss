        RedMonk said Java has never faced more competition for developer time and attention than it does now. While Java will be an enterprise mainstay for years to come, the firm said that Javaâ€™s prominent position is no longer guaranteed. (Java recently slipped to number two in the Tiobe language rankings as well, behind C, after more than five years at the top.)

The RedMonk language rankings are extracted from analyses of GitHub and Stack Overflow. For GitHub, RedMonk queries languages based on pull requests, leveraging GitHub Archive. For Stack Overflow, discussions on languages are assessed.

Also in the June rankings, Rust reached the top 20 for the first time, ranking 20th. It placed 48th five years ago. Kotlin, ranked 19th in the June report, was ranked 68th five years ago.
